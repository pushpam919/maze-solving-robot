# maze-solving-robot
This project showcases a maze-solving robot designed to autonomously navigate through a maze using algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), or Wall-Following. The robot is equipped with sensors to detect walls and open paths, making real-time decisions to find the shortest or most efficient route to the maze's exit.

Features:
Autonomous Navigation: The robot detects obstacles and paths using sensors and computes the optimal route.
Algorithm Support:
Wall-Following (Left/Right-Hand Rule)
Depth First Search (DFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS)
A* for shortest pathfinding
Sensor Integration: Ultrasonic, IR, or LiDAR sensors for obstacle detection.
Modular Design: Easy to switch between algorithms and hardware components.
Simulation Support: Virtual testing in environments like ROS, Webots, or Gazebo.
